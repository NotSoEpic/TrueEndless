True Endless adds endless versions of all ammo and consumables
[c/FFFF99:ALL ammo and consumables]
Even from [c/FFFF99:any] mod
[c/AAAAAA:(hopefully)]
It works by not actually adding new items!

[c/AAFFAA:Step one:] Make the "Endless Enabler" item using various items at a crystal ball and use it
[c/AAFFAA:Step two:] Have a max stack of ammo [i/s999:97] or consumable item [i/s30:292]
[c/AAFFAA:Step three:] Watch that item become all cool and [i/s1:2870] rainbowy [i/s1:2966] (unless you don't like that, then disable it in the settings)
Potions are even nice enough to [c/FFFF99:constantly give you] [c/FFFF99:their buff] without you having to drink it

[c/FFFF99:Specifics:]
 [c/AAAAAA:Ammo:]
 - Is ammo
 - Max stack greater than one
 [c/FFAAAA:Consumables:]
 - Anything that doesn't place tiles or walls
 - Max stack greater than one

[c/FFFF99:Other endless items:]
 - Regular ol' torches
 - Beach balls. Never enough beach balls

[c/DD0000:Known Incompatibilities:]
 - Potions that give multiple buffs wont constantly give you their buffs (I don't think theres any way to fix this besides a hard coded item by item basis)
